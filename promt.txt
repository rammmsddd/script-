 PROMPT (Kopyala):
"Write a Blender addon (__init__.py) called 'Slack Cable Generator'.
Workflow:
User selects two objects or two vertices.
Script creates a Bezier Curve connecting them.
The Physics Simulation: The curve must simulate gravity. The center control point should hang lower than the endpoints.
UI Panel (N-Panel > Cables):
Slack Amount: Float (How much the cable hangs down).
Thickness (Bevel Depth): Float (Thickness of the cable).
Resolution: Int (Smoothness of the curve).
Profile: Enum [Round (Cable), Square (Duct)].
Code Logic:
Add a Bezier Curve with 3 points: Start, Middle (lowered by Slack amount), End.
Set handle types to 'AUTO' or 'ALIGNED' for a smooth arc.
Add geometry bevel depth automatically."
